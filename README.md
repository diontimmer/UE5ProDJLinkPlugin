# UE5 ProDJLink Plugin

**Beat Link Trigger / Pioneer Gear Support for Unreal Engine 5**

This plugin links **Unreal Engine 5** with Pioneer CDJs and DJM mixers via [Beat Link Trigger](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link-trigger). It supplies a Blueprint-friendly interface and asset system for synchronizing gameplay, visuals, and other events with DJ equipment.
